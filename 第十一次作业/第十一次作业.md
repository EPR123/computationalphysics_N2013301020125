#Precession as a function of eccentricity

##Abstract

The precession of the perihelion of a planet's orbit due to general relativity varies as a function of the eccentricities of the orbit is investigated by changing eccentricity,while keeping the value of the perihelion the same as for mercury.The rate of precesssion is caculated and presented through numerical computation at different eccentricities.As it turns out,precession as a function of eccentricity is different from as a function of alpha.The orbit is getting greater as eccentricity becoming larger（less than 1),and the period of the orbit is evolving in the same way.
