##Abstract

- The precession of the perihelion of a planet's orbit due to general relativity varies as a function of the eccentricities of the orbit is investigated by changing eccentricity,while keeping the value of the perihelion the same as for mercury.The rate of precesssion is caculated and presented through numerical computation at different eccentricities.As it turns out,precession as a function of eccentricity is different from as a function of alpha.The orbit is getting greater as eccentricity becoming larger（less than 1),and the "period" of the orbit is evolving in the same way.


##Introduction
###The precession rate as a function of alpha due to general relativity is a single line.How about the precession rate as a function of eccentricity?It is interesting to study.

###Keeping the same value of the perihelion as for Mercury,i.e.

###Thus

###And keeping alpha=0.01,time step equals to 0.0001 yr. For a particular eccentricity.To begin with,calculating x position and y position.Then to find out the position when the time derivative of distance of planet changes from positive to negative.In the second place,calculating the angles between the joint line from origin to these positions and x axis.Then computing the rate of precession for this eccentricity.

###When e=0.2,the trajectory acts like this

###It is very similiar to that of Mercury when alpha is 0.01.Its figure of orientation of orbit versus time is![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/orbit_e%3D0.2.png)

###When e=0.4,the trajectory acts like this![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/e%3D0.4.png)
###Its precession becomes even more obvious,but the rate is becoming smaller.And its "period" is getting larger.Its figure of orientation of orbit versus time is ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/orbit_e%3D0.4.png)

###When e=0.6,the trajectory acts like

###Again,smaller rate of precession and larger "period".Note that the size of the orbit becomes huger. Its figure of orientation of orbit versus time is

###When e=0.8,the trajectory acts like
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/e%3D0.8.png)
###Here we get even smaller rate of precession and greater "period" as well as a huger orbit.Its figure of orientation of orbit versus time is 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/orbit_e%3D0.8.png)

###When e=0.9,the trajectory acts like
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/e%3D0.9.png)
###Its figure of orientation of orbit versus time is 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/orbit_e%3D0.9.png)

###A firmed point can be draw that with larger eccentricity,comes smaller rate of precession and greater "period",besides huger orbit.

###Changing eccentricity step to be de=0.01,we get enough data to make the relationship between rate of precession and eccentricity clear.The relationship looks like

###Now we can find rate of precession for a particular eccentricity.

##Conclution

###The rate of precession varies as a function of the eccentricity of the orbit like this
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/rate.png)
###As it turns out,besides huger orbit,the rate is getting smaller and the "period" is becoming greater as eccentricity is being larger.
