##Abstract

###The motions of billiard on isosceles triangle is investigated by calculating and understanding the resulting trajectories.It turns out that in some directons,the motion is perfectly periodic.While in other directions,it is totally chaotic.The motion is very sensitive to direction.The results are made to be more precise by taking smaller time step around collisions with the walls.The resulting trajectories are presented with both matplotlib and vpython.
