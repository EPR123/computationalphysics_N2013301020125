##Abstract

###The motions of billiard on isosceles triangle is investigated by calculating and understanding the resulting trajectories.It turns out that in some directons,the motion is perfectly periodic.While in other directions,it is totally chaotic.The motion is very sensitive to direction.The results are made to be more precise by taking smaller time step around collisions with the walls.The resulting trajectories are presented with both matplotlib and vpython.

##Introduction

###There are many more chaotic systems.To get appreciation,here we consider the proble of a ball moving without friction on a horizontal table.We imagine that there are walls at the edges of the table that reflect the ball perfectly and there in no frictional force between the ball and the table.The ball is given some initial velocity.So the direction of initial velocity is specified.And the trajectory is calculated.
