###Abstract

An investigated on collision of string wavepackets is done through numerical computation.The initial string profile is Gaussian .Both single and double Gaussian pluck are included.It shows that two such wavepackets pass through each other without changing  shape or speed.The string signals versus time are also presented.It turns out that the signals are  quite different at different position.And there are reasonable explanations for these signals.
