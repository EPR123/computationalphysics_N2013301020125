##Simulation of wavepackets collisions

####黄程   2013301020125

###Abstract

An investigated on collision of string wavepackets is done through numerical computation.The initial string profile is Gaussian .Both single and double Gaussian pluck are included.It shows that two such wavepackets pass through each other without changing  shape or speed.The string signals versus time are also presented.It turns out that the signals are  quite different at different position.And there are reasonable explanations for these signals.

###Introduction

An important feature of a linear equation is that the sum of two solution is also a solution.One consequence of this is that the sum of two wavepackets will travel independently of each other.An especially clear way to demonstrate this is to set up a string with an initial profile such that there are two Gaussian wavepackets,located at different places on the string.These wavepackets(or components of them) may the propagate toward each other and collide.Is the two wavepackets are unaffected by these collisions?

To begin with,we review our simualtion on the string with one Gaussian pluck.The initial displacement of each point on the string is

And the result of the simulation is
