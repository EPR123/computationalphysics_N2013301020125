###Abstract

An investigated on collision of string wavepackets is done through numerical computation.The initial string profile is Gaussian .Both single and double Gaussian pluck are included.It shows that two such wavepackets pass through each other without changing  shape or speed.The string signals versus time are also presented.It turns out that the signals are  quite different at different position.And there are reasonable explanations for these signals.

###Introduction

An important feature of a linear equation is that the sum of two solution is also a solution.One consequence of this is that the sum of two wavepackets will travel independently of each other.An especially clear way to demonstrate this is to set up a string with an initial profile such that there are two Gaussian wavepackets,located at different places on the string.These wavepackets(or components of them) may the propagate toward each other and collide.Is the two wavepackets are unaffected by these collisions?

###Text

To begin with,we review our simualtion on the string with one Gaussian pluck.The initial displacement of each point on the string is

And the result of the simulation is

It can be seen that the two components are unaffected by these collisions,that is,without changing shape or speed.And they reform the initial profile after an interval of time.
Then we pick two points,one is a tenth from the left end,the other is the center.Here we show the string signal versus time of these two point.

The signal of the left point is

And the signal of the center is

It is obvious that these two figure look so different.The second figure has a better symmetry.And the reason should be that it is because the different position.It can be seen from the former figure that the lower peaks of it have larger distances while the later figure shows a uniformed distance between lower peaks.So the cause must be the different in position.

Next,we add another Gaussian pluck to the string.Thus the initial profile looks like this

The result of simulation is

Angain,these wavepackets pass through each other without changing shape or speed and reform the initial profile after some time.
Also,we choose the two same points as in the case of single Gaussian pluck.And drawing the figures of string signal versus time.Here we get

They are different from each other,but the figure of the center point still gets a better symmetry.It is easy to understand that the initial profile is symmetrical.It is the same cause as in the case of one Gaussian pluck.But the amplitude of the signal at the left point is half the value of the center.It is because the left point would never have the opportunity when the two Gaussian totally add.It is just the priority for the center to have it.When comparing the signals at the same point but different initial profile.We find that the density of peaks at the left point in the case of two Gaussian pluck is larger than the case of one Gaussian pluck.The understanding is straightforward.But the density of peaks at the center is same in the two cases.I believe that it is because the symmetry,when one components pass the center,another one pass it two,so the whole effect is as the same with the case of one components.Note that the amplitudes are different too.And the reason is also straightforward.

###Conclusion

Two such wavepackets pass through each other without changing  shape or speed.
