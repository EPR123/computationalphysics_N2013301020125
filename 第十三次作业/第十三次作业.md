###Abstract

The magnetic field prudoced by a coil wrapped on a torus is investigated through numerical computation.The results are presented in vpython.It turns out that this magnetic field is different from that of a solenoid.

###Introduction

The magnetic field generated by a straight wire or a solenoid is quite familiar to us.How about the magnetic field generated by a coil wrapped on a torus which looks like this

It is known from the later discussion that the field looks like this

###Text

To begin with,we have to do some mathematics.

In the first place, the parametric equations of such coil is

And the differentiation respect to x,y,z is

Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field produced by a current I flowing in a wire segment says

Where ds is a segment in the coil,and r is the distance of a special position from the segment.To calculate the magnetic field of this position,we just need to sum up all the magnetic field generated by each segment.

The magnetic field generated by a given segment is

Thus the components are

So,in every loop of the program,just update the value of each component in order to sum up the value of magnetic field of each segment.

Now I should present the results.In the first place,the distribution of magnetic field near the axis of the torus is as the figure below

Here above I show the distribution of B on a equivalant cylindrical surface which radius is 0.5,and z varies from 0 to 3.We can include from the figure that B is almost upward but on the plane of z=0,the orientation of B is parallel to z=0 plane and its value is fairly small,as expected.
