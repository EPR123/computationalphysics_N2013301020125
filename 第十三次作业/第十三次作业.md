###Abstract

The magnetic field prudoced by a coil wrapped on a torus is investigated through numerical computation.The results are presented in vpython.It turns out that this magnetic field is different from that of a solenoid.

###Introduction

The magnetic field generated by a straight wire or a solenoid is quite familiar to us.How about the magnetic field generated by a coil wrapped on a torus which looks like this

It is known from the later discussion that the field looks like this

###Text

To begin with,we have to do some mathematics.

In the first place, the parametric equations of such coil is

And the differentiation respect to x,y,z is

Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field produced by a current I flowing in a wire segment says

Where ds is a segment in the coil,and r is the distance of a special position from the segment.To calculate the magnetic field of this position,we just need to sum up all the magnetic field generated by each segment.
