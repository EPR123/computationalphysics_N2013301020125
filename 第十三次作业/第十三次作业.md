###Abstract

The magnetic field prudoced by a coil wrapped on a torus is investigated through numerical computation.The results are presented in vpython.It turns out that this magnetic field is different from that of a solenoid.The value of B outside the coil is comparable to that of the inside section.It means that the value of B outside the coil is not negligible.

###Introduction

The magnetic field generated by a straight wire or a solenoid is quite familiar to us.How about the magnetic field generated by a coil wrapped on a torus which looks like this

It is known from the later discussion that the magnetic field looks like this

###Text

To begin with,we have to do some mathematics.

In the first place, the parametric equations of such coil is

And the differentiation of each component respect to x,y,z is

Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field produced by a current I flowing in a wire segment says(Here I choose the current I to be the value that makes the coefficient to be 1)

Where ds is a segment in the coil,and r is the distance of a special position from the segment.To calculate the magnetic field of this position,we just need to sum up all the magnetic field generated by each segment.

The magnetic field generated by a given segment is

Thus the components are

So,in every loop of the program,just updating the value of each component in order to sum up the value of magnetic field of each segment.

Now I should present the results.In the first place,the distribution of magnetic field near the axis of the torus is as the figure below

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%89%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/r%3D0.5.png)

Here above I show the distribution of B on a equivalant cylindrical surface which radius is 0.5,and z varies from 0 to 3.We can include from the figure that B is almost upward but on the plane of z=0,the orientation of B is parallel to z=0 plane and its value is fairly small,as expected.

When radius turn to 1,I get

It looks quite similarly to the case of radius is 0.5

Enlarging the radius to 2 leading to

Changes have come out that the orientation of B is not so upward and its value has change obviously.

Further,when radius is 3,I get

As a surprise,the value of B outside the coil is comparable to the inside section,which is not the case of a solenoid.And the direction of B is tend to be parallel to z=0 plane.

As a verification,I present the cases when radius is 3.5,4 and 5,orderly

###Conclusion

The value of B outside the coil wrapped on a torus is comparable to that of the inside section.Which is not the case that the value of magnetic field outside the solenoid is negligible.The reason might be that the coil of this shape can not concentrate the magnetic filed as it is wrapped on a torus.What is the case if the rings add to a very large number?The result may be the same as both the value of B outside and inside become larger proportionally.But the value of B at the position far away from the torus is vanishingly,as expected.The orientation of magnetic field at the axis of the torus is supposed to parallel to the axis.
