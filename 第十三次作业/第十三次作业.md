###Abstract

The magnetic field prudoced by a coil wrapped on a torus is investigated through numerical computation.The results are presented in vpython.It turns out that this magnetic field is different from that of a solenoid.

###Introduction

The magnetic field generated by a straight wire or a solenoid is quite familiar to us.How about the magnetic field generated by a coil wrapped on a torus which looks like this

It is known from the later discussion that the field looks like this
