##黄程  2013301020125

##Abstract
###Strange attractors of a pendulum model are investigated by altering small changes in drive amplitude.It turns out that when drive amplitude belongs to a small interval,the motion of a pendulum with particular conditions is chaotic,and else it is damping decay or periodic oscillation after a shortly damping decay.

##Introduction
###What is the relationships between chaos and surface of strange attractor?It is of interesting to study.

###Assuming that q=0.5,l=g=9.8,drive frequency to be 2/3,dt=0.01,all in SI.The initial conditions are theta(0)=0.2,omega(0)=0.

###Using Euler-Cromer method to write main part of codes as
    while time[i]<=7000:    
        omega.append(omega[i]+(-sin(theta[i])-0.5*omega[i]+1.2*sin(time[i]*2/3))*dt)
        char=theta[i]+omega[i+1]*dt
        if theta[i]+omega[i+1]*dt<-pi:        
            theta.append(char+2*pi)
        elif theta[i]+omega[i+1]*dt>pi:
            theta.append(char-2*pi)
        else:
            theta.append(char)
        time.append(time[i]+dt)    
        i=i+1

###Starting from when drive amplitude is 1.2,and results in

###Its strange attractor is

###It is surely chaotic but no more conclution can be draw here until comparision.

###Changing drive amplitude to be 1.5,yields

###Its strange attractor is

###It is still chaotic under this drive amplitude,and you can find that the strange attractors of the above two situation is very similar.Is this kind of strange attractor can be seen as a charactor of chaotic?Yet to be.

###When drive amplitude is 2,yields

###When seeing care fully,you can find that this motion can be seen as quasi-periodic.It seems that when the drive amplitude is getting larger than 1.2,the motion has a trend to be periodic.

###What dos its strange attractor look like?Here comes

###Obviously,there are less dots in the surface.

###Changing drive amplitude to be 2.1,yields

###The strange attractor is

###Changing drive amplitude to be 2.2,yields
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B9%9D%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/Fd%3D2.2.png)

###The strange attractor is

###After comparing all above we can draw a firm conclution.That is,the surface of strange attractor is getting cleaner when the drive amplitude is getting larger,corresponding to be more orderly in the motion.

###How about when the drive amplitude is less than 1.2?

###Changing drive amplitude to be 1.1,yields
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B9%9D%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/Fd%3D1.1.png)

###It is also quasi-periodic too.And its strange attractors is 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B9%9D%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/FD%3D1.1.png)
###It looks as clean as when the drive amplitude is 2.1.

###Changing drive amplitude to be 1,yields
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B9%9D%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/Fd%3D1.png)
###It is indeed periodic after a short chaotic decay.The strange attractor is

###Again,the surface gets cleaner.

###Changing drive amplitude to be 0.8,yields
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B9%9D%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/Fd%3D0.8.png)

###Its strange attractor is 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenghuang2016/computationalphysics_N2013301020125/master/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B9%9D%E6%AC%A1%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/FD%3D0.8.png)

###Here again,we can draw a firm conclution.That is,as in the case when drive amplitude is getting larger and larger,when the drive amplitude is get less and less than 1.2,the surface of strange attractor is becoming cleaner,and the motion is getting more orderly,or in another words ,to be "more periodic".

##Conclution

###As it turns out,when drive amplitude belongs to a small interval,the motion of a pendulum with particular conditions is chaotic,and else it is damping decay or periodic oscillation after a shortly damping decay.The surface of strange attractor is getting cleaner when the drive amplitude is getting larger than about 1.2 or less than about 1.2, and the motion is becoming more orderly up to be periodic.The intuition explaination might be that when driving force is getting larger,the effect of gravity or damping can be ignored,the motion suppose to be more orderly.When driving force is getting less is that the driving force cancels the damping,just as the motion is affected only by gravity,so the motion ought to be periodic too.The interval for pendulum to be chaotic might settle at about 1.2.
