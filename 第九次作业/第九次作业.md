#An investigation on strange attractors of a pendulum model

##黄程  2013301020125

###Abstract:Strange attractors of a pendulum model are investigated by altering small changes in drive amplitude.It turns out ###that when drive amplitude belongs to a small interval,the motion of a pendulum with particular conditions is chaotic,and else ###it is damping decay or periodic oscillation after a shortly damping decay.
