##Abstract:
###Runge-Kutta methods is used here to calculate the motion of swing with large angles.It turns out that Runge-Kutta methods improve the stablity of the outcome,comparing to Euler methods.Swings with a variaty of angles is discussed.It shows that the swing is exactly a periodic ocsillation,no matter how large the angle is.The larger the angle，the greater the deviation from sinusoidal.Figures under both matplotlib and vpython are presented.
