##Abstract

###Simulations in which the motions of Earth, Jupiter, and the Sun are calculated through numerical computation.The sun is given an initial velocity in order to make the center of mass remain fixed.The motion of Earth is investigated by changing different initial conditions,such as initial position,initial velocity or its mass.The effect from Jupiter on the motion of Earth is also been studied by increasing the mass of Jupiter to 10, 100, and even 1000 times its actual value.

##Introduction

###We know that Earth  has been orbiting the  Sun for several billion years, so the orbit must be fairly stable.

###So, what accounts for this ? And we also know that the Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, besides that it is reasonably close to Earth.What effect it has on Earth ? What about changing its mass to 100 times of its actual value ? Well, A numerical computation gives the result

###It can be seen that even the mass of Jupiter is 100 times of its actual value, Earth is still orbiting sun though Sun is also orbiting the center of mass,just like moon orbiting Earth while Earth is orbiting Sun.Mind that the motion of Jupiter is almost undisturbed even though the mass of Sun is still ten times of Jupiter's.So what the hell is this.I have mentioned that I give an initial velocity to Sun for the sake of keeping the center of mass unchanged. Thus Jupiter orbits the center of mass from the begining on,and since the mass of Earth can be omit when comparing to Jupiter's actual mass,not to 100 times of it.
