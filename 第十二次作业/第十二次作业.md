##Abstract

###Simulations in which the motions of Earth, Jupiter, and the Sun are calculated through numerical computation.The sun is given an initial velocity in order to make the center of mass remain fixed.The motion of Earth is investigated by changing different initial conditions,such as initial position,initial velocity or its mass.The effect from Jupiter on the motion of Earth is also been studied by increasing the mass of Jupiter to 10, 100, and even 1000 times its actual value.

##Introduction

###We know that Earth  has been orbiting the  Sun for several billion years, so the orbit must be fairly stable.

###So, what accounts for this ? And we also know that the Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, besides that it is reasonably close to Earth.What effect it has on Earth ? What about changing its mass to 100 times of its actual value ? Well, A numerical computation gives the result

###It can be seen that even the mass of Jupiter is 100 times of its actual value, Earth is still orbiting sun though Sun is also orbiting the center of mass,just like moon orbiting Earth while Earth is orbiting Sun.Mind that the motion of Jupiter is almost undisturbed even though the mass of Sun is still ten times of Jupiter's.So what the hell is this.I have mentioned that I give an initial velocity to Sun for the sake of keeping the center of mass unchanged. Thus Jupiter orbits the center of mass from the begining on,and since the mass of Earth can be omit when comparing to Jupiter's actual mass,not to say 100 times of it.And so does Sun.

###Including the effect of Sun on Earth and Jupiter to subroutine jupiter-earth descriped in page 115 of text book.   I got the result just as the normal animation presented in Introduction.

###To begining with, I changed the initial positon of Earth to various values while keeping all the other parameters unchanged(Mind that the mass of Jupiter is of its actual value).Initially, when Earth is away from Sun,leading to

###It can be seen that when Earth starts at a far point, its orbit tend to be unstable.While Earth is close to Sun initally,it yeilds

###In contrast, when Earth starts at a close location, its orbit is still fairly stable.But it can not be confirmed that the orbits of these kinds can last for billions of years.

###Further,just changing the initial velocity of Earth, we get

###Or

###It is almost the same result as we changing the initial position.

###Further more,changing the mass of Earth while leaving all the other values fixed.

###We can see that the motion of Jupiter is affected most as the mass of Earth gets larger.And eventually Jupiter is ejected from the solar system.

###And finally,just increasing the mass of Jupiter to 10, 100, 1000 times of its actual value.

###In these cases, the motion of Earth is affected most.Also, Earth is ejected from the solar system.

##Conclusion

###From the all above discussion, it can be drawn that only the all kinds of parameters of each planet take appropriate values, the equilibrium of solar system can be achieved.
